# EDA-CircleSalesAnalysis
This project focuses on analyzing sales data from the Circle store using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. The aim is to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can help drive data-informed decisions.

Key Highlights
Visual Representations:
Utilized various data visualization tools like histograms, box plots, bar charts and heatmaps to explore relationships between features and identify trends in sales performance.

Feature Engineering:
Created new derived features such as:
Categorical groupings of items or outlets
Transformation of numerical columns to handle outliers and skewed data

Univariate & Bivariate Analysis:
Analyzed each column independently and in pairs to study distributions and interrelationships.

Data Cleaning:
Handled missing values, corrected inconsistent entries, and standardized formats for clean and consistent analysis.

The notebook contains step-by-step analysis with clearly labeled visual insights and conclusions.
